🎬 Movie Data Analytics Project
This project is a comprehensive data analytics initiative focusing on insights from a movie dataset. The objective is to explore, clean, and analyze data to discover trends in ratings, genres, popularity, and revenue using Python.

📁 Repository Contents
mymoviedb2.xlsx

mymoviedb3.xlsx

mymoviedb4.xlsx — Multiple versions of the movie dataset containing information like title, genre, budget, revenue, popularity, rating, and release year.

movie1.ipynb — A Jupyter Notebook that includes end-to-end data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.

📊 Project Objectives
Understand patterns in movie production and performance.

Clean and consolidate Excel data for effective analysis.

Use visual storytelling to highlight correlations in budget, revenue, popularity, and ratings.

Gain insights into top-performing genres and years.

🔍 Key Features
🧹 Data Cleaning: Handling nulls, duplicates, and incorrect datatypes.

📈 Data Visualization: Charts and graphs using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

🎞️ Genre Analysis: Breakdown of most popular and highest-grossing genres.

📆 Yearly Trends: Revenue and rating trends over time.

🔍 Correlation Analysis: Exploring relationships between variables (e.g., budget vs. revenue, popularity vs. rating).

📦 Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib, Seaborn

OpenPyXL (for reading Excel)

Jupyter Notebook

💡 Insights
Certain genres consistently generate higher revenue than others.

Popularity does not always correlate with high ratings or earnings.

Movie production peaked during certain periods (depending on dataset).
